# Popcorn Flow

## **O**ptions

^ The power of options 

## **P**roblems (& Observations) → **O**ptions → **P**ossible Experiments

^ Options come for problems
You do experiments

## **P**roblems (& Observations) → **O**ptions → **P**ossible Experiments → **C**ommitted → **O**ngoing → **R**eview → **N**ext

^ Change is hard, so make it continuous

# Your facilitators

* Austin
* Steve

# Set the scene

* This is Season X
* Recap story so far
* Assign families. colour print out: family name, crest, and words. Goes on to poster by the table.

## Wall walk: resources

* What are this family's resources? (Have prompts ready)
* Write 1 thing on your poster
* Move 1 poster left
* Write 1 thing
* Repeat until you've written on every poster
* Circle the **best 4** on your family's poster

# Problems (& Observations)

* Goal: you want dat throne
* Generate problems on stickies
* Dot vote to pick one to work on (2m)
* Observations (5m)

# Options

* Generate 3 options
* What can you do with your resources?
* What’s the impact?
* We’ll measure it later
* Pick one to do first

# Possible Experiments

* Generate at least 2 per option
* "Yes and"
* Okay to be vague (?)
* Index cards with: 1. elevator pitch of experiment; 2. resources needed for it (need counters for these?).
* Remember: more resources means more weighted against success.
* Remember: they should be rapid, focus on continual change.

# Committed

* What's the **expected** outcome?

# Ongoing

* What's the shortest?
* What will let you learn the most, fastest?
* Another table chooses it for you? GoT style: little agency and bad things happen! Possibly not very Popcorn-y, but does have options as the focus.

# Review

* Move 1 table to your left
* Decide the **actual** outcome?
* What are the consequences of this outcome? Does it change Problems or Options?

# Next

* Generate more Options for same problem
* Pick an option to work on (can be an old one)
* Commit to experiement
* Generate the result
