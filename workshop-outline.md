# Reality!

![](img/cast.jpg)

^ - We develop products. We build features. We follow a process.
- We don't know what the future holds.
- Fearful Fiascos?
- Budget slashed. New competitor in the market. No one likes the product. No one uses the feature. Much more work than we estimated.

---

## It's not fail fast, fail often, it's **learn fast, learn often**.

^ - Glorious success?
- Delivered on time. Great ROI. But was it the best option? How do you know?
- If you are going to follow a plan
- Make sure you understand the problem and it's impact.
- Think of options that address it.
- Conquer complexity by listening to all the opinions.

---

## Everybody has<br>an opinion, but<br>**a shared opinion<br>is a fact**.

^ - Rapid explorations and experiments
- Respond to change

---

## Change is hard, so let's **make it continuous**.
