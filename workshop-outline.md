![](img/resources/unsullied.jpg)
![](img/resources/melisandre.jpg)
![](img/resources/fleet.jpg)

^ Wall walk
Have prompts ready

---

## Move 1 poster clockwise<br><br><br>
## Write 1 resource<br>on the poster

^ And again
Repeat until you've written on every poster

---

## Circle the best 4 on your family's poster

^ You'll use these in a minute
2m

### **Problems**

## Generate problems<br>on stickies

^ Put up ":point_up: you are here"
5m

### **Problems**

## Dot vote to pick one<br>to work on

^ 2m

---

## Observations

^ 5m

---

### **Options**

## Generate 3 options
### What can you do with your resources?
### What’s the impact?

^ Move ":point_up: you are here"
We’ll measure it later

---

### **Options**

## Pick one to do first

---

### **Possible Experiments**

## At least 2 per option

^ Move ":point_up: you are here"
Grab an index card and a pen

---

^ four bits

![original](img/options-card-experiment-and-resources.jpg)

^ "Yes and"
Okay to be vague (?)
More resources means more weighted against success.
Should be rapid and focus on continual change.

## More resources means more weighted against success.
## Should be rapid and focus on continual change.

---

### **Committed**

## What's the *expected* outcome?

^ Move ":point_up: you are here"

---

![](img/options-card-expected-outcome.jpg)

---

### **Ongoing**

## What's the shortest?
## What will let you learn the most, fastest?

^ Move ":point_up: you are here"
Another table chooses it for you? GoT style: little agency and bad things happen! Possibly not very Popcorn-y, but does have options as the focus.

---

### **Review**

## Move 1 table clockwise
## Circle one of<br>the outcomes :grimacing:

^ Move ":point_up: you are here"
Handout outcomes sheet
Back to your table

## What's the *actual* outcome?

---

### **Review**

## What are<br>the consequences of<br>this outcome?

---

### **Next**

### Generate more Options for same problem

^ Move ":point_up: you are here"

---

### **Next**

### Pick an option to work on<br>(can be an old one)

# Reality!

![](img/cast.jpg)

^ - We develop products. We build features. We follow a process.
- We don't know what the future holds.
- Fearful Fiascos?
- Budget slashed. New competitor in the market. No one likes the product. No one uses the feature. Much more work than we estimated.

---

## It's not fail fast, fail often, it's **learn fast, learn often**.

^ - Glorious success?
- Delivered on time. Great ROI. But was it the best option? How do you know?
- If you are going to follow a plan
- Make sure you understand the problem and it's impact.
- Think of options that address it.
- Conquer complexity by listening to all the opinions.

---

## Everybody has<br>an opinion, but<br>**a shared opinion<br>is a fact**.

^ - Rapid explorations and experiments
- Respond to change


---

## Change is hard, so let's **make it continuous**.
