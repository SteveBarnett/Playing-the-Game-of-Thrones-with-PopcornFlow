Reality tie -in

We develop products. We build features. We follow a process. 

We don't know what the future holds.

Fearful Fiascos?

Budget slashed. New competitor in the market. No one likes the product. No one uses the feature. Much more work than we estimated.

It's not fail fast, fail often, it's learn fast, learn often.

Glorious success?

Delivered ontime. Great ROI. But was it the best option? How do you know?

If you are going to follow a plan

Make sure you understand the problem and it's impact.

Think of options that address it.

Conquer complexity by listening to all the opinions.

Everybody has an opinion, but a shared opinion is a fact.

Rapid explorations and experiments

Respond to change

Change is hard, so let's make it continuous.
