So things like Castle and Wall are a bit arb but I was thinking we could do this, have people add resources but also a different type of thing- like a location/situation and that location is where the problem is situated, so if situation is Castle the problem could be attacking/siege. We could even make a list and each group dot votes (as one dot for the group) for the situation they want to put the family in. This will help make the thinking of a problem easier as it narrows the frame of reference yet the possibilities are endless.
