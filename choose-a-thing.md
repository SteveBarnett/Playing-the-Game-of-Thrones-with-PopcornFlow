- Death, out of the blue
- Somebody’s life is changed forever, in a bad way
- Confusion, followed by pain
- A neighbor wanders into the situation
- Collateral damage
- A visit from the (perhaps unofficial) authorities
- Betrayed by friends
- Greed leads to killing
- A showdown
- A stranger arrives to settle a score
- Two people cross paths and everything changes
